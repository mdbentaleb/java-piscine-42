Java is a strictly typed programming language. Fundamental data types (boolean, character, integer, floating point number) are represented in Java by eight primitive types: boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double.

Work with integer type.

Calculate the sum of digits of a six-digit int number (the number value is set directly in the code by explicitly initializating the number variable).

Example of the program operation for number 479598:

```bash
	$> java Program
	42
```
